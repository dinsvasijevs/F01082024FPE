### Codelex Final Project

This is a final project for Codelex Bootcamp by **Dins Vasijevs**.

The application replicates a digital banking platform with built-in cryptocurrency trading capabilities. It provides secure registration and authentication for both individual and corporate users. Users can create and manage cash accounts, each denominated in their chosen currency. The system also supports connections between users, facilitating smooth money transfers. When a transfer requires currency conversion, the exchange rates are automatically retrieved from the CurrencyBaconApi.
